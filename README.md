# BMI & BMR Calculator

A simple **BMI & BMR Calculator** built using **React**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  
It allows users to log in, calculate BMI with categories, calculate BMR based on weight, height, age, and gender, and navigate between calculations easily.

## Features

## How It Works
1. The user first **logs in** by providing their name, date of birth, and password.
2. After login, the user is presented with options to **calculate either BMI or BMR**.
3. Once the user completes a calculation, the app asks if they want to perform the other calculation.
4. The user can **switch between BMI and BMR calculations** as many times as they want.
5. The results are displayed with clear messages, including BMI category or BMR in kcal/day.
